PONG - Nic Depper, August 11, 2025
A simple game of Pong. Some room for improvement, but in its current state, can definitely be called a "Game"

CURRENT ISSUE - AUG 11/2025
-An attempt to add a pause feature on scoring is not quite working.
-When a countdown timer is enabled, the game will successfully pause for the alotted time, but the ball will not reset to the correct position
-However, when the pause feature is disabled, the ball correctly resets. 

CONTROLS:

Player 1:
W - Move Up
S - Move Down

Player 2:
Up - Move Up
Down - Move Down
